# ðŸª„ Frame Surgeon 2 

Frame Surgeon remains an easy, simple program many people know and like.  
Rewritten from the ground up with multitude of new features and enhancements.

It's a app mainly intended for rapid generation of flip books or sprite sheets out of individual frames that are used in game development and other media.  
Do it fast, do it in bulk!

### Here's what you can't find in the previous Java version:

- Good (better) UX
- Dismantle Flipbook mode
- Previews
- Loading/Saving setups
- Simple frame annotation
- Progress bar :)

You can find binaries under Releases of this repository.  
Hovering over UI elements will tell you what they do.
